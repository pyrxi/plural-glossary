        <h1>Glossary</h1>
        <p>This is a list of words that are often used in the plural community. The goal of this list is to define and categorize these terms as they're used by the community. The goal is <i>not</i> to dispute the objectivity, validity or correctness of any of these terms. These terms are included for no other reason than their use in the broader community.</p>

        <p>It is our belief that every form of plurality is valid. There is no "incorrect" way to be plural. However, this belief is irrelevant to the goal of this glossary. It is, fundamentally, about cataloging the terms and defining how they're used in the community.</p>

        <p>With that said, this also isn't a definitive list. Not every word used by the community is going to be listed here. A word missing from this list doesn't speak to its use or legitimacy as a word in the community. If a word isn't on here, we either don't know about the word, or it's been left out for one reason or another. If you'd like to ask about a word, you can send us an email at pyrxi@plurallabs.net, or reach us through the community server.</p>
